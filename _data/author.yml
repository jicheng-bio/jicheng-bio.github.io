# 个人简介
bio: |
   I received my Ph.D. and B.S. degree from Beihang University (BUAA), advised by Prof. Li Jianxin.​ I have published about 30 CCF-A/B papers, including NeurIPS, ICLR, AAAI, IJCAI, WWW, MM, etc. Google Scholar citations exceed 1,600.

   I won the best paper candidate of CIKM 2022, ICDM 2021, and the First Prize of Natural Science from the Chinese Institute of Electronics (中国电子学会自然科学一等奖).
   
   I am serving as the program committee member and reviewer for Cell Patterns, IEEE TIP, ICML, ICLR, NeurIPS, KDD, AAAI, etc.
